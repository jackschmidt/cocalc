# CoCalc

One easy way to get started with Ximera is to use CoCalc (formerly SageMathCloud), a web-based cloud computing platform.  CoCalc provides an Ubuntu-based linux environment with a LaTeX editor.  By following the instructions below, you can configure CoCalc to edit Ximera worksheets.

## Getting Started

1. Go to https://cocalc.com/ and create a project that has internet access (which requires a membership to cocalc.com)
2. In your newly created project, click on the "Create or Upload Files" button.
3. Choose "Terminal" to create a terminal where you will be able to enter commands.
4. In the terminal, run the command
```
curl -L https://go.osu.edu/ximera-cocalc | bash
```
This will populate your CoCalc project with the files necessary to use Ximera.
